First, update your system's package list and upgrade existing packages:
Code

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y


2. Add the Ansible PPA:
Install software-properties-common to manage repositories, then add the Ansible PPA:
Code

sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible


3. Install Ansible:
Now, install Ansible using apt:
Code

sudo apt install ansible -y

4. Verify Installation:
Confirm that Ansible has been installed successfully by checking its version:
Code
