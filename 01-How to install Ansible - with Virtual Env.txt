o install Ansible within a Python virtual environment on Ubuntu, follow these steps: Install Python3 and pip.
Ensure you have Python3 and its package installer, pip, installed on your system.
Code

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip


Install python3-venv.
This package provides the venv module for creating virtual environments.
Code

    sudo apt install python3-venv


create a virtual environment.
Navigate to your desired directory and create a new virtual environment. Replace my_ansible_env with your preferred environment name.
Code

    mkdir ansible_projects
    cd ansible_projects
    python3 -m venv (my_ansible_env)


Activate the virtual environment.
This step changes your shell's environment to use the Python and pip within your newly created virtual environment.
Code

    source my_ansible_env/bin/activate


Your command prompt should now display the virtual environment's name, e.g., (my_ansible_env) user@hostname:~/ansible_projects$.
Upgrade pip within the virtual environment (recommended):
Ensure you have the latest version of pip within your virtual environment for better package management.
Code

    pip install --upgrade pip


install ansible.
Now, install Ansible using pip. It will be installed within your active virtual environment.
Code

    pip install ansible


Verify the installation.
Confirm that Ansible is installed and accessible within your virtual environment.
Code

    ansible --version


The output should show the Ansible version and indicate that it's running from your virtual environment's Python path.
To exit the virtual environment, use the deactivate command:
Code

deactivate
